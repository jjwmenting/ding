		<h2>Ding</h2>
		<p>Ding builds your software projects, producing programs you can then use in other systems to deploy.</p>
		<p>The following concepts play a role in ding:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Repositories</li>
			<li>Builds</li>
			<li>Results</li>
			<li>Releases</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Repositories</h3>
		<p>Ding assumes a software project is in a version control system. On each build, ding clones the repository. Per ding repository, you need to configure a shell script <tt>build.sh</tt>. It must compile the software, run tests, create releasable results.</p>
		<p>A repository exists so you can create execute <em>builds</em>.</p>

		<h3>Builds</h3>
		<p>A build is an attempt to compile the software and create releasable results. A build runs through (hopefully all) of the following steps:</p>

		<h4>new</h4>
		<p>Waiting to be started: we only run 1 concurrent build per repository, regardless of branch, to prevent access to a shared resource, for example a database.</p>

		<h4>clone</h4>
		<p>Fetching source code. Ding calls the external programs git or hg or runs the code-fetching shell script. If you specify <tt>origin</tt> URLs that make use of SSH, you will probably also need to install ssh keys in $HOME/.ssh for the unix user Ding is running under. In that case, make sure sure the private key file is only accessible by the user (not group, permission 0400) ding is running under.</p>

		<h4>build</h4>
		<p>Executes your build.sh script. If you need resources such as a database, you should configure them beforehand. Ding always runs at most 1 concurrent build per repository, so builds won't overwrite each other's data during a build. If you want to keep data in the database after a build is finished, you have two options: 1. Make a backup/dump of the database. 2. Dynamically create a database as part of the build script.</p>

		<h4>success</h4>
		<p>Successful builds should have results that can be released.</p>

		<p>Builds are automatically cleaned up to reclaim disk space. Only the last build per branch and released builds are never deleted. Unreleased builds can also have just their build directory removed to reclaim space. Those builds exist in the database, but cannot be opened to see details.</p>

		<p>The goal of a build is to create <em>results</em>.</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>Results are just files that can be released. For Java projects, they are typically jar files. For Go projects, they are typically binary files, one for each architecture you compiled for. The output of your build.sh scripts points to the files that are results. Results only exist in the build directory and are removed when the build is removed.</p>
		<p>Ding picks up output of the following form as results:</p>
		<blockquote style="font-size: inherit">release: $name $version $platform $architecture $toolchainversion $path</blockquote>
		<p>For example:</p>
		<blockquote style="font-size: inherit">release: ding 0.1.2 linux amd64 go1.12.5 ding-0.1.2-linux-amd64-go1.12.5</blockquote>
		<p>You can also <em>release</em> results.</p>

		<h3>Releases</h3>
		<p>Releases are builds of which the results have been saved outside the build directory, including the build script and output captured during the build. The build directory can then be cleaned.</p>

		<h2>API</h2>
		<p>Ding has an API at <a href="/ding/">/ding/</a>.</p>

		<h2>File hierarchy</h2>
		<p> Overview of how where files are stored on disk by ding:</p>
		<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap">
data/
    build/&lt;repoName&gt;/&lt;buildID&gt;/       ($DING_BUILDDIR during builds)
        checkout/$DING_CHECKOUTPATH/  (working directory for build.sh)
        scripts/
            build.sh                  (copied from database before build)
        output/
            {clone,build}.{stdout,stderr,output,nsec}
        home/                         ($HOME during builds with unique UIDs)
        dl/                           (files stored here are available at /dl/file/&lt;repoName&gt;/&lt;buildID&gt;/)
    release/&lt;repoName&gt;/&lt;buildID&gt;/
        &lt;result-filename&gt;
    home/&lt;repoName&gt;/                  ($HOME during builds with shared UIDs)
